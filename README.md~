### EKF-SLAM using UTIAS dataset
![output figure](/images/slam_trajs_landmarks.png)

The objective of this project is to localize a mobile robot moving in an unknown environment and also localize the landmarks in the environment. We have used EKF-filtering technique for the localization of the robot itself and the landmarks. The main output of the project is shown in the figure above. The estimated trajectory of the robot is plotted in green and the ground truth of the trajectory is shown in the orange lines. Similarly the estimated locations of the landmarks are plotted in brown triangles and their ground truth locations are plotted in red triangles.
